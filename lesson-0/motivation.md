# Motivation to course

Maybe you already tried to jump into JavaScript and
got stuck in the middle of all these super shiny libraries
you absolutely need to know before you can write anything meaningful.

Surprisingly, there is even article about it: [How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f)

So you might be asking yourself - why learn JavaScript?

## Why JavaScript

**It's everywhere!** not only in your browser:
  - [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) - framework for desktop apps,
    used already by several companies, e.g. guess what's behind Slack...
  - [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for native mobile applications
  - [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), together with web framework like [Express](http://expressjs.com/), for your backend side

[Why JavaScript Is and Will Continue to Be the First Choice of Programmers](https://dzone.com/articles/why-javascript-and-will)

It's also the most active language on [Github](http://githut.info/), which is
hugely empowered by robust ecosystem of libraries,
that are maintained via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), package manager.

But the most importantly, it's the *lingua franca* of the web. Browsers understand to only one language, and it's JavaScript.


## Why learn & keep learning?

Rome wasn't built in a day. So your programming skills. It's completely natural
to fail several times before you learn enough from your mistakes.
And even then you have to keep going as technology around is evolving, so DON'T PANIC :)

*“True self-confidence is “the courage to be open—to welcome change
and new ideas regardless of their source.” Real self-confidence
is not reflected in a title, an expensive suit, a fancy car,
or a series of acquisitions. It is reflected in your mindset:
your readiness to grow.”*
